```

The architecture follows a modular design with clear separation of concerns:

1. **Data Pipeline**: Handles data collection, preprocessing, and feature engineering
2. **Model Training**: Manages model selection, training, and evaluation
3. **Model Serving**: Provides an API gateway with authentication and serving predictions
4. **Deployment**: Handles containerization and deployment using CI/CD
5. **Monitoring**: Tracks performance metrics and error rates

## Implementation Details

### Data Processing

The project uses the Sentiment140 dataset, which contains 1.6 million tweets labeled for sentiment analysis. The data processing pipeline:

1. Loads the raw data from CSV
2. Cleans text by removing special characters, links, and stopwords
3. Performs tokenization and stemming using NLTK
4. Converts text to numerical features using TF-IDF vectorization
5. Splits data into training and test sets (80/20 split)
6. Saves the vectorizer model for reuse during inference

Code snippet for text preprocessing:

```python
def preprocess_text(text):
    # Remove special characters and numbers
    text = re.sub(r'[^a-zA-Z\s]', '', text, re.I|re.A)
    text = text.lower()
    
    # Tokenization and stopword removal
    tokens = word_tokenize(text)
    tokens = [token for token in tokens if token not in stopwords.words('english')]
    
    # Stemming
    stemmer = PorterStemmer()
    tokens = [stemmer.stem(token) for token in tokens]
    
    return ' '.join(tokens)
```

### Model Development

The model development process involved:

1. Exploring different algorithms (Naive Bayes, SVM, Random Forest)
2. Feature engineering with TF-IDF vectorization
3. Hyperparameter tuning using grid search with cross-validation
4. Model evaluation with accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score
5. Version control of model artifacts using joblib serialization

The final model selected was a Multinomial Naive Bayes classifier, achieving 76.12% accuracy on the test set. The model and vectorizer are serialized using joblib for persistence.

Model selection code:

```python
# Configure the classifier
model = MultinomialNB(alpha=0.1)

# Train the model
model.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Make predictions on test data
y_pred = model.predict(X_test)

# Evaluate the model
accuracy = accuracy_score(y_test, y_pred)
precision = precision_score(y_test, y_pred, average='binary')
recall = recall_score(y_test, y_pred, average='binary')
f1 = f1_score(y_test, y_pred, average='binary')

print(f"Accuracy: {accuracy:.4f}")
print(f"Precision: {precision:.4f}")
print(f"Recall: {recall:.4f}")
print(f"F1 Score: {f1:.4f}")
```

### API Implementation

The API was implemented using FastAPI, which provides:

1. REST API endpoints for prediction
2. Input validation using Pydantic models
3. HTTP Basic Authentication for secure access
4. Swagger documentation
5. Health check endpoints
6. Prometheus integration for monitoring

Code snippet from the API implementation:

```python
@app.post("/predict")
async def predict_sentiment(
    request: SentimentRequest,
    credentials: HTTPBasicCredentials = Depends(security)
):
    verify_credentials(credentials)
    
    try:
        # Preprocess the input text
        preprocessed_text = preprocess_text(request.text)
        
        # Transform the text using the vectorizer
        vectorized_text = vectorizer.transform([preprocessed_text])
        
        # Make prediction
        prediction = model.predict(vectorized_text)[0]
        probability = model.predict_proba(vectorized_text)[0].max()
        
        # Map the prediction to a sentiment label
        sentiment = "positive" if prediction == 1 else "negative"
        
        # Log the prediction
        logger.info(f"Prediction made: {sentiment} with confidence {probability:.4f}")
        
        return {
            "text": request.text,
            "sentiment": sentiment,
            "confidence": float(probability),
            "timestamp": datetime.now().isoformat()
        }
    except Exception as e:
        logger.error(f"Error during prediction: {str(e)}")
        raise HTTPException(status_code=500, detail=f"Prediction error: {str(e)}")
```

### Authentication

The API implements HTTP Basic Authentication with configurable credentials:

```python
# Authentication setup
security = HTTPBasic()

def verify_credentials(credentials: HTTPBasicCredentials):
    correct_username = os.getenv("API_USERNAME", "admin")
    correct_password = os.getenv("API_PASSWORD", "password")
    
    current_username_bytes = credentials.username.encode("utf8")
    correct_username_bytes = correct_username.encode("utf8")
    current_password_bytes = credentials.password.encode("utf8")
    correct_password_bytes = correct_password.encode("utf8")
    
    is_username_correct = secrets.compare_digest(
        current_username_bytes, correct_username_bytes
    )
    is_password_correct = secrets.compare_digest(
        current_password_bytes, correct_password_bytes
    )
    
    if not (is_username_correct and is_password_correct):
        logger.warning(f"Failed authentication attempt: {credentials.username}")
        raise HTTPException(
            status_code=status.HTTP_401_UNAUTHORIZED,
            detail="Incorrect username or password",
            headers={"WWW-Authenticate": "Basic"},
        )
    
    return True
```

### Docker Implementation

Docker containerization was implemented to ensure consistent deployment:

1. Multi-stage builds for efficient image size
2. Alpine-based images to minimize footprint
3. Non-root user execution for security
4. Volume mounting for persistent data
5. Health check configuration

Dockerfile for the API:

```dockerfile

        password: ${{ secrets.DOCKER_HUB_ACCESS_TOKEN }}
    
    - name: Build and push Docker image
      uses: docker/build-push-action@v2
      with:
        context: .
        file: ./Dockerfile.heroku
        push: true
        tags: ${{ secrets.DOCKER_HUB_USERNAME }}/sentiment-analysis-api:latest
```

### Required GitHub Secrets

For the CI/CD pipeline to work correctly, the following secrets need to be configured in the GitHub repository:

- `DOCKER_HUB_USERNAME`: Docker Hub username for pushing images
- `DOCKER_HUB_ACCESS_TOKEN`: Docker Hub access token for authentication

## Testing Strategy

The project implements a comprehensive testing strategy:

### Unit Tests

Unit tests focus on testing individual components in isolation:

- Model preprocessing functions
- Vectorization functions
- Prediction logic
- API request validation

Example unit test:

```python
def test_preprocess_text():
    # Test with normal text
    text = "Hello, this is a test! 123"
    processed = preprocess_text(text)
    assert "hello" in processed
    assert "test" in processed
    assert "," not in processed
    assert "123" not in processed
    
    # Test with empty text
    assert preprocess_text("") == ""
    
    # Test with special characters only
    assert preprocess_text("!@#$%^&*()") == ""
```

### Integration Tests

Integration tests verify the interaction between components:

- API endpoint functionality
- Authentication flow
- End-to-end prediction pipeline
- Error handling

Example integration test:

```python
def test_predict_endpoint():
    # Test with valid credentials and input
    response = client.post(
        "/predict",
        json={"text": "I love this product!"},
        auth=("admin", "password")
    )
    assert response.status_code == 200
    assert "sentiment" in response.json()
    assert "confidence" in response.json()
    
    # Test with invalid credentials
    response = client.post(
        "/predict",
        json={"text": "I love this product!"},
        auth=("wrong", "credentials")
    )
    assert response.status_code == 401
```

2. Prometheus configuration is included in the project
3. Key metrics tracked include:
   - Request count and latency
   - Prediction distribution
   - Error rates
   - System resource usage

Prometheus configuration (prometheus.yml):

```yaml
global:
  scrape_interval: 15s

scrape_configs:
  - job_name: 'sentiment-api'
    static_configs:
      - targets: ['api:8004']
```

## Challenges and Solutions

### Challenge 1: Dependency Compatibility

**Problem**: The initial model training used scikit-learn 1.2.2, but Docker deployment required compatibility with older versions.

**Solution**: Created a separate environment for training with specific library versions:
- scikit-learn==1.3.0
- numpy==1.24.3
- joblib==1.3.1

This ensured consistent behavior across environments.

### Challenge 2: Memory Optimization

**Problem**: The full Sentiment140 dataset (1.6M tweets) required significant memory during training.

**Solution**: Implemented batch processing and optimized the vectorization process:
- Used sparse matrices for TF-IDF vectors
- Implemented early stopping during model training
- Reduced vectorizer vocabulary size

### Challenge 3: Docker Container Size

**Problem**: Initial Docker image was over 1.2GB, making deployment slow.

**Solution**: Optimized the Docker image:
- Used multi-stage builds
- Switched to slim Python base image
- Removed unnecessary dependencies
- Excluded development packages

## Future Work

### Planned Enhancements

1. **Model Improvements**:
   - Experiment with transformer-based models (BERT, DistilBERT)
   - Implement model A/B testing infrastructure
   - Add multi-language support

2. **Infrastructure Improvements**:
   - Implement MLflow for experiment tracking
   - Set up model versioning and registry
   - Add automated retraining pipeline

3. **API Enhancements**:
   - Implement rate limiting
   - Add OAuth 2.0 authentication
   - Create batch prediction endpoint

4. **Monitoring Enhancements**:
   - Set up alerting based on model drift
   - Implement dashboard for performance visualization
   - Add user feedback collection mechanism

## Conclusion

The Sentiment Analysis MLOps project successfully demonstrates a comprehensive approach to deploying machine learning models in production. By integrating best practices from both software engineering and data science, the project achieves a balance between model performance, deployment reliability, and operational efficiency.

The modular architecture enables easy maintenance and future extensions. The CI/CD pipeline ensures consistent testing and deployment, reducing the risk of regression errors. The monitoring solution provides visibility into system performance and model behavior in production.
